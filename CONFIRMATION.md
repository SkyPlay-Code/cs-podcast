# Confirmation of Understanding: CS-11: NCERT Decoded - Core Vision & Design System

This document confirms understanding of the core vision, architectural layout, technology stack, and design system specifications for the "CS-11: NCERT Decoded" project.

## 1. Project Core Concept & Architectural Layout

I understand the project "CS-11: NCERT Decoded" is envisioned as a **Single-Page Application (SPA)** dedicated to delivering **educational audio content**. The guiding design principles are **clarity, accessibility, and navigational simplicity**, aiming for an intuitive and professional user experience that prioritizes content consumption.

The architectural layout specifies:
*   **SPA Structure:** All content will be rendered dynamically on the client-side.
*   **Primary Viewport:** A central, scrollable content area will display primary content, such as a list of audio episodes.
*   **Persistent Audio Player:** A critical UI component, the audio player, will be **docked to the bottom of the viewport** (`position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;`). It will have a **higher z-index** to remain visible above other content and its state (current track, playback status, progress) will be **globally managed**.

## 2. Technology Stack Confirmation

I confirm the chosen technology stack for this project is:
*   **React:** Version 18+ with TypeScript (`.tsx` files).
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling, adhering to the provided design system.

## 3. Design System Pillars Acknowledgement

I acknowledge and will adhere to the following key pillars of the design system:

### 3.1 Color Palette
The specified color tokens will be implemented in `tailwind.config.js` and used according to the mandate:
*   `background`: `#F0F2F5` (Light Gray) - For global page background.
*   `surface`: `#FFFFFF` (White) - For cards, headers, modal backgrounds.
*   `brand`:
    *   `DEFAULT`: `#3B82F6` (Professional Blue) - For primary interactive elements.
    *   `light`: `#60A5FA` - For hover/focus states.
    *   `dark`: `#2563EB` - For active/pressed states.
*   `text`:
    *   `primary`: `#1F2937` (Near Black) - For headings, primary body copy.
    *   `secondary`: `#6B7280` (Medium Gray) - For descriptions, metadata, placeholders.

### 3.2 Typography
Typography rules will be followed:
*   **Primary Font Family:** `Inter`, with `Poppins` as a fallback, configured as the default sans-serif font family.
*   **Font Weights & Styles:**
    *   Headings: `font-semibold` (600).
    *   Body & Paragraphs: `font-normal` (400).
    *   Buttons & Strong Labels: `font-medium` (500).

### 3.3 Spacing, Sizing, and Layout Grid
The 8-point grid system will be strictly adhered to:
*   Utilizing Tailwind's default spacing scale (based on 0.25rem / 4px unit).
*   All margin, padding, gap, width, and height values will conform to this scale (e.g., `p-2` for 8px, `p-4` for 16px).

### 3.4 Border Radius & Shadow
Visual styling for elevation and softness will be applied:
*   **Corner Rounding:** `rounded-lg` (0.5rem / 8px) for primary containers (cards, audio player).
*   **Elevation & Depth:** `shadow-md` for cards to create hierarchy and separation.

I am prepared to proceed with development based on these specifications, ensuring the generated React application embodies these design principles and technical requirements.
